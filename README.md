### Mussels: Unbelievingly Slim and Simple - Even Limiting - Shell

Mussels is a tiny shell in C++ I am building as a proof-of-concept for an Operating Systems course.
It is not meant to be POSIX compliant nor have all of the basic features used in most shells.

## How to Run

    make
    ./mussels

## Development State

Mussels is not currently being actively worked on. That being said, if you want to contribute to this project, please feel free to either message me for more information or to directly send in a pull request.
